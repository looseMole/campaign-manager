# The properties of a charactersheet
These varies based on which TTRPG you are playing I'd imagine.  
Personally, I've only ever really played 1 though, thus it might be possible to notice some creative influences in the
following "analysis":

A character sheet hold's _a lot_ of info about a character. All of which I currently intend to encapsulate somehow, with
the Player class.
These attributes include (I'll exclude putting "the character's" in front of them all):
- Name
- Class(es) & level(s)
- Background
- The name of the Player
- Race
- Alignment
- XP
- Inspiration Points
- Proficiency Bonus
- Abilities:
  - Strength
  - Dexterity
  - Constitution
  - Intelligence
  - Wisdom
  - Charisma
- Skills (A list of skills, with a base score/modifier based on abilities, with possibilities to be increased by stuff 
like proficiencies.)
- Saving Throw Bonuses - one for each Ability
- Passive Perception
- Proficiencies (A list of skills, tools, and languages)
- Armor Class (or AC)
- Initiative
- Movement Speed (With the possibility for separate flying, climbing and swimming).
- HP (Current, max and temporary)
- Hit dice (Type and amount)
- Death saves
- An inventory (Including Weapons, Provisions, Consumables, "Treasure" and Equipment)
- Spellcasting Ability
- Spellsave DC
- Spell Attack Bonus
- Spell List (Both learned and prepared)
- Feature list
- Feat list
- An arbitrary "notes" area.
